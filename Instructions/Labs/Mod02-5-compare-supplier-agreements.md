# Compare supplier agreements using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word
---
Microsoft Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word is an AI assistant that can help sales professionals work more efficiently and effectively. With Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word, salespeople can create, edit, and summarize documents with ease. It can also help them personalize customer interactions and streamline their workflow with AI support.

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word can help salespeople build strong relationships with their customers, take actions based on insights, and close deals faster. It can also help salespeople transform text into tables, or provide suggestions for ways to rewrite content. Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word can bring in specific information from other documents into your content, generate summaries, ask questions about your document, and even provide ideas about specific topics.

In this training exercise, you provide Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word with three supplier agreement documents. You then ask it to create a report that compares the terms and conditions negotiated with each customer. You also ask Copilot to provide recommendations for renegotiating each agreement.

During this exercise, notice how easy it is to have Copilot regenerate a new version of the report. When you're not satisfied with one version, you just select a **Regenerate** button to have Copilot create a different version of the document, all within a matter of seconds.

### Exercise

You're the new Sales Manager for Northwind Traders, a supplier of various grocery and beverage products. You're concerned about the supplier agreements that are currently in place with several of Northwind's top customers. Your predecessor negotiated these agreements, so you aren't familiar with the terms and conditions that were previously agreed upon with these customers. You plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word to compare the supplier agreements and create a report that compares the results and provides recommendations for future agreements.

To access the supplier agreements, you must first download the files, and then copy them to your OneDrive account. Copilot can only access files on a OneDrive account. In this exercise, you access the files in Copilot by selecting them from the Most Recently Used (MRU) list. For the files to appear in the MRU list, you must open and close each one.

Perform the following steps to generate your speech using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word:

1.  Select the following links to download the three supplier agreements:
     -  [Contoso Supplier Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268925)
     -  [Tailwind Traders Supplier Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269128)
     -  [Wide World Importers Supplier Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268931)
2.  Once the downloads are complete, open **File Explorer** and copy the files from your **Downloads** folder to a folder in your OneDrive account.
3.  In this exercise, you access the documents from the Most Recently Used file list. To get the files to appear in the MRU list, open each document and then close it. Open and close each of the three files in your OneDrive account.
4.  In **Microsoft 365**, open **Microsoft Word** and then open a new blank document.
5.  In the **Draft with Copilot** window that appears at the top of the blank document, enter the following prompt:
    
    **I'm the Sales Manager for Northwind Traders, a supplier of various grocery and beverage products. Please create a report that compares the supplier agreements for three of our customers**. **Provide a recommendation on contract renewals that can provide Northwind Traders with more favorable terms. The supplier agreements for these three customers are attached**. **Thank you**!
6.  You now must attach the three supplier agreements to the prompt. In the **Draft with Copilot** window, select the **Reference your content** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, if the **Contoso Supplier Agreement** appears in the list of files, select it. Otherwise, select **Browse files from cloud**, select the **Contoso Supplier Agreement** from the **Recent** file list, and then select the **Attach** button. Note how the file is displayed in the prompt.
7.  Repeat the prior step for both the **Tailwind Traders Supplier Agreement** and the **Wide World Importers Supplier Agreement**. At this point, links to all three files should be included in the prompt.
8.  Select **Generate**. At this point, Copilot extracts the pertinent information from the three supplier agreements drafts a report comparing them.
9.  After reviewing the speech, you aren't pleased with the results. You would like to see Copilot try again and generate a new version. In the Copilot window that appears at the end of the document, select the **Regenerate** button, which appears next to the **Keep it** button. You can repeat this step as many times as necessary until Copilot creates a version of this report that you approve. For this exercise, repeat this step several times to see the various formats that Copilot delivers. Also note how some information may be included in one version of the report that's not in others.
10. Once you're satisfied with a version of the report, select the **Keep it** button.
11. Once you're done with this document, save it to your OneDrive, so you can close this tab in your Microsoft Edge browser.
