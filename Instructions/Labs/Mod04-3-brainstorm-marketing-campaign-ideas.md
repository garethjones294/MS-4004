### Exercise

In the prior exercise, Tailspin Toys conducted a market analysis of the toy industry. Based on that analysis, the company decided to introduce a new line of outdoor toys. As a Marketing Program Manager at Tailspin Toys, you are tasked with creating marketing campaigns for this new line of toys. You decide that your first step is to use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Loop to help brainstorm ideas for marketing campaigns targeted at this new product line. Perform the following steps to brainstorm ideas using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Loop:

1.  In **Microsoft 365**, select **Loop** if it appears in the left-hand navigation pane. If it doesn't appear there, then select **Apps**, and on the **Apps** page, scroll down to locate **Loop** and then select it.
2.  In **Microsoft Loop**, select **Get Started**.
3.  In **Loop**, the **Workspaces** tab is displayed by default. You want to create a new workspace for this project, so select the **+** icon to create a new workspace.
4.  In the **Create a new workspace** window, enter **Outdoor toy line Marketing Campaign** for your workspace name and then select either the **Continue** or **Create** button that appears (depending on your Loop version).
5.  In the **Add files to your workspace** window (depending on your version of Loop, this window may say **Workspace Switcher**), select **Create workspace**.
6.  You're now on the first page for your new workspace. The name of the page is currently **Untitled**. Note the page (Untitled) also appears in the left-hand navigation pane. In the main body of the page, select in the **Untitled** field and change the name of the page to **Ideas for Outdoor toy campaigns**. Note how the page name is automatically updated in the navigation pane.
7.  In the **Just start typing...** field, enter a forward slash **(/)**.
8.  In the drop-down menu that appears, under the **Copilot** section at the top of the menu, select **Draft page content**.
9.  In the **Copilot** window that appears, note the row of buttons that appears below the prompt field. Select each button (**Create**, **Brainstorm**, **Blueprint**, and **Describe**). When doing so, note how it prefills the prompt field with an example of the type of task that Copilot can assist with. Since this exercise deals with brainstorming, select the **Brainstorm** button.
10. Note how Copilot prefills the prompt field with a brainstorming suggestion. In fact, select the **Brainstorm** button multiple times. Note how it suggests a new brainstorming prompt each time. Copilot loops through seven different brainstorming examples, and then starts back over. The purpose of these examples is to give you an idea as to the eclectic types of things that Copilot can help you brainstorm. For this exercise, enter the following prompt field and select the **Submit** icon:
    
    **Brainstorm 10 ideas for a marketing campaign for a new line of outdoor toys**.
11. Review the generated list of ideas. Rather than having all the information in a paragraph or list form, you prefer to summarize it in a table. Plus, you also want Copilot to provide more specific details for each idea, In the **Copilot** pane that appears, enter the following prompt in the **Rewrite with Copilot** field and select the **Submit** icon:
    
    **That looks good. However, please rewrite the report by placing the information in a table and provide more specific details for each idea**.
12. Note how Copilot changed the formatting of the report. You now want Copilot to add another idea to the table titled **Supermarket store promotions**. To do so, enter the following prompt:
    
    **Add an idea for Supermarket store promotions**.
13. When you ask Copilot to add a new idea, it may add it into a new table, or it may add it to the end of the current table. Either way, you decide after further reflection that promoting outdoor toys in a supermarket is a lousy idea, and you no longer want it included in the list. So how can you undo what you just did?
    
    To the right of the table (either your original table or a new one with just the **Supermarket store promotions** idea), note how Copilot tracks each of your prompts. The prompts are displayed from the most recent prompt down to the first prompt, in sequential order. More importantly, note how each prompt includes an **Undo** icon. If you're unhappy with the results of a prompt, you can undo it to go back to the version of the draft before that prompt. Since you've decided that you no longer want to include **Supermarket store promotions** in the table, select the **Undo** icon for that prompt.
14. After selecting the **Undo** icon, note how Copilot deleted the prompt and returned you to the draft following the second prompt that put the ideas in a table. At this point, you're ready to have Copilot sort the ideas from best to worst. Enter the following prompt to sort the ideas:
    
    **Please sort the ideas in the table starting from most effective to least effective**.
    
    > **NOTE:** Locate the **Sort** icon (the up and down arrows) that appears in the icon tray above the list of ideas. This option simply sorts the ideas in alphabetical sequence. You can perform the sort on either the name of each **Idea** or the first word in each **Details** field. However, it isn't based on the estimated effectiveness of the ideas, which is what you want, and what you requested in the prompt.
15. After reviewing the sorted ideas, you decide to make one final change. You want Copilot to replace the least effective idea with a campaign event titled **Seasonal Promotions**. You think it's a natural fit for a new toy line that focuses on outdoor products. To do so, enter the following prompt:
    
    **Please replace the final idea in the table with Seasonal Promotions**.
16. You're now satisfied with the list of ideas, which you can later present to your marketing team. When it's time to present the list of marketing campaign ideas that you brainstormed with the help of Microsoft 365 Copilot in Loop, you can access the **Ideas for Outdoor toy campaigns** workspace that Loop automatically saved.
