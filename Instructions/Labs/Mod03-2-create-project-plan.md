Create a project plan using Microsoft 365 Business Chat
---
Business Chat  can revolutionize the way IT professionals collaborate and communicate in the digital workspace. It seamlessly integrates into Microsoft 365 and offers a robust platform for IT professionals to enhance teamwork, share insights, and accelerate problem-solving within the IT ecosystem.

Business Chat  serves as a central hub for real-time collaboration. It enables IT professionals to connect instantly, share information, and coordinate efforts efficiently. This powerful tool enables streamlined communication, breaking down silos and fostering a collaborative environment where IT teams can collectively address challenges and share valuable expertise.

This training exercise uses Microsoft Microsoft 365 Copilot on https://Microsoft.com/Copilot to create a project plan to install a network security product. You begin by asking Copilot to analyze a product specification report for a new network security product that you plan to install. You then ask it to update the project plan with information from the product spec report.

### Exercise

As the Director of IT at Adatum Corporation, you've been reviewing a product specification report for the Contoso CipherGuard Sentinel X7 network security product. You plan to install this product, which provides advanced security protection that is far beyond anything Adatum has today. However, given the complexity of your corporate network, you want to create a project plan to guide the implementation. As such, you want Copilot to create a project plan based on IT industry guidelines for installing network security components. You then want Copilot to analyze the product spec report and incorporate its requirements into the project plan.

> **NOTE:** At the end of this exercise, you must save your project plan to your OneDrive account. The next exercise uses this file.

To reference the file in Copilot, this exercise locates the file from the Most Recently Used (MRU) file list.

Perform the following steps to create your project plan using Microsoft Microsoft 365 Copilot on https://Microsoft.com/Copilot:

1.  Select the following link to download a copy of the [Contoso CipherGuard Product Specification report](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269123).
2.  Once the download is complete, open **File Explorer** and move the file from your **Downloads** folder to a folder in your OneDrive account.
3.  In this exercise, you access the document from the MRU file list. To get the file to appear in the MRU list, open the document and then close it.
4.  In **Microsoft Edge**, enterthe following URL: **https://Microsoft.com/Copilot**
6.  On the **Copilot** page, in the **Work/Web** toggle switch at the top of the page, select **Work**.
7.  By default, the **Work** option limits Copilot's reach to your Microsoft 365 organizational data. However, since you also want Copilot to access the public web guidelines on installing a corporate network security product, you must enable the **Web content** plugin. To do so, in the prompt field at the bottom of the page, you should notice two icons - the paper clip icon, which is to attach files, and an icon of stacked blocks. This latter icon is the Plugins icon. Select this **Plugins** icon.
8.  In the **Plugins** window that appears, if the **Web content** toggle switch is set to **Off**, then select it now to turn it **On**.
9.  You're now ready to use Copilot. Enter the following prompt, which directs Copilot to access public web data through the **Web content** plugin to Business Chat , and then select the **Submit** arrow in the bottom corner of the prompt field:
    
    **I'm the Director of IT at Adatum Corporation. Create a project plan for installing a new network security product into a corporate network. Base this plan on IT industry guidelines for installing network security products**.
10. Review the project plan that Copilot created. You aren't satisfied that it encompasses all the areas that it should. Enter the following prompt to have it amend its plan by including areas of specific interest to you. If any of the areas included in this prompt are already in Copilot's previous response, then remove them from this prompt so that Copilot doesn't duplicate them:
    
    **While that was a good start, I feel like it's missing important areas. Please add the following items to the existing list: testing and QA, training, communication, document and reporting, stakeholder analysis, project timeline, and risk assessment and mitigation.**
11. Review the amended project plan. You're happy with the breadth of topics covered, so now you want Copilot to update the plan with information from the product spec for the Contoso CipherGuard Sentinel X7 security product. Enter the following prompt, but don't submit it yet as you must first link the file to the prompt in the next step:
    
    **This version looks better. Please review the attached file, which is a product specification for the Contoso CipherGuard Sentinel X7 security product, and update your project plan with information from this product spec**.
12. In the prompt field, enter a space after the prompt and then type a forward slash (/). You must enter the space before the forward slash so that Copilot recognizes it as a request to attach something to the prompt. Your next step depends on whether Copilot opens a window for you to select the file:
     -  If Copilot opens a window after you entered the forward slash (/), then select the **Files** tab. Doing so displays the list of MRU files. Select the **Contoso CipherGuard Product Specification** file and then select the **Submit** icon.
     -  If Copilot didn't do anything after you entered the forward slash (/), then you'll have to copy and paste in the link to the **Contoso CipherGuard Product Specification** file. To do so, locate the file in your OneDrive account, open it in **Word**, select the **Share** button that appears above the Word ribbon, select **Copy link** in the drop-down menu that appears, and then back in this prompt field, paste in the link following the forward slash and select the **Submit** icon.
13. Review how Microsoft 365 Copilot inserted features from the product spec into the project plan. While this looks good, you feel that the project plan is lacking in specific details. To address this issue, enter the following prompt:
    
    **We're almost there. Please break down each item on the report into multiple detailed steps**.
14. Review the results. Now that the project plan is created, you MUST save it to a Word document. **You'll use this project plan document in the next exercise**. At the bottom of Copilot's final response, select the down arrow icon (**Export**) to export the contents of the response. A drop-down menu appears that allows you to select the type of file you want to export the response into. Select **Word**. An **Exporting** window should appear while Copilot exports the content to a Word document. The **Exporting** window disappears once the process is complete.
    > **NOTE:** If the export option is not available, copy the output into a new Word document (navigate to word.new in your browser) and save it as "Contoso CipherGuard project plan.docx". Then, skip step 15.
15. In the **Microsoft 365** tab in your browser, select **Word.** On the **Word** home page, the first file that appears in the list of MRU files should be this Word document that Copilot created. Our testing showed the file name was usually something like "**CopilotAnswers-xxx(date)xxxxxx-xxxxxx.**" Select this file to open it and verify that it contains the project plan that Copilot exported. Save the file to your OneDrive account that contains the product specification document that you used in this exercise. Then rename this file from **CopilotAnswers-xxx(date)xxxxxx-xxxxxx.docx** to **Contoso CipherGuard project plan.docx**. You'll use this file in the next exercise.
