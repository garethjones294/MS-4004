# Create a speech using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word
---
Mastering Copilot for Word can be a transformative skill for executives and leaders, enabling them to craft impactful communications such as speeches, memos, and organizational-wide emails. Effective communication is crucial for executives and leaders to convey messages clearly to fellow leaders, employees, and other stakeholders.

In this example, lets imagine that you have to write a speech for an upcoming event. Copilot for Word serves as a collaborative writing assistant, intelligently suggesting content and refining language in real-time. This tool not only expedites the speech writing process but also ensures clarity, coherence, and resonance in the final message.

Using Copilot for Word gives you a competitive edge by effortlessly translating your ideas into compelling narratives that captivate audiences. This tool enhances your creativity and efficiency, empowering you to deliver speeches that resonate powerfully. Copilot helps you foster a stronger connection with your audience, leaving a lasting impact and highlighting your leadership skills.

### Linking files in Copilot

In this exercise, you direct Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word to write a speech for you based on information that is stored in a Word document. As you may recall from earlier training, when you link a file such as this into a Copilot prompt, the file MUST be located in a OneDrive account. You can't link to a locally stored file on your PC.

You can link the file into the Copilot prompt using one of the following methods:

 -  Select the file from the Most Recently Used (MRU) file list.
 -  Open the file and copy its path using the **Share** option, then paste the path into the prompt following the forward slash (/).
 -  Copy the file's path from File Explorer and paste it into the prompt following the forward slash (/).

In this exercise, you'll select the document from the MRU file list.

### Exercise

Letâ€™s imagine you're a CTO within a large organization and you have a meeting in the coming days with other executives from other parts of your organization. During this meeting, you will present the status of your organization's digital transformation. Your assistant has provided you with a summary of updates regarding this effort.  

You plan to use Copilot to write your speech based on the information in the summary document. This exercise walks you through a series of prompts that you can use to have Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word generate your speech and then update it based on your suggested changes.

To reference the file in Copilot, this exercise locates the file from the MRU file list.

Perform the following steps to generate your speech using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word:

1. Select the following link to download a copy of [Digital Transformation Summary.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277632).

2. Once the download is complete, open **File Explorer** and move the file from your **Downloads** folder to a folder in your OneDrive account.

3. In this exercise, you access the document from the MRU file list. To get the file to appear in the list, open the document and then close it.

4. In **Microsoft 365**, open **Microsoft Word**, and then open a new blank document.

5. In the **Draft with Copilot** window that appears at the top of the blank document, enter the following prompt:
    
    **Write a speech for the upcoming Digital Transformation update meeting that summarizes the progress and impact found in the attached file**.

6. In the **Draft with Copilot** window, select the **Reference your content** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **Browse files from cloud**.

7. In the **Pick a file** window that appears, under the **Recent** file list, select the **Digital Transformation Summary.docx** file and then select the **Attach** button. Note how the file is displayed in the prompt.

8. Select **Generate**. At this point, Copilot extracts information from the summary and drafts a speech. After reviewing the speech, you decide that it's a good starting point, although there are a few areas that you want to modify.

9. In the Copilot window at the end of the speech, select the **Keep it** button.

10. Highlight the section of the speech you want to modify, then select the Copilot icon on the left and choose **Write a prompt**.

11. In the prompt window, write a prompt to modify the section in some way. For example:

    - "**Rewrite the 3rd bullet to include [topic to include]**"
    - "**Rewrite the introduction to this section. Keep it professional in tone**".

12. Once Copilot is done generating the new section, select **Keep it**.

    > **NOTE:** Copilot will duplicate the content with the modifications asked for included. If you want to keep the new version, delete the old text.

13. For curiosity's sake, you want to have Copilot regenerate the speech. Highlight all the text in the body of the document, select the Copilot icon on the left, and then select **Auto Rewrite**.

14. Copilot will rewrite the selected text for you. After reviewing the text, you decide you'd like the speech to sound more professional. In the **Rewrite with Copilot** window, select the **Adjust Tone** option.

15. From the options, select **Professional** and then select **Regenerate**.

16. At this point, you are done making edits and are happy with the Speech. In the **Rewrite with Copilot** window, select **Replace**.

17. Save the file to your OneDrive account with the following file name: **Digital Transformation Speech.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.
    
    > **IMPORTANT:** Ensure that you save the file to your OneDrive rather than your local PC. In the next exercise, you use Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint to create a slide presentation based on this document. The document must be in OneDrive for Copilot to access it.

18. Close the tab containing this document in your Microsoft Edge browser.
